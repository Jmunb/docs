# What is dfinance


«dfinance» [diːfaɪˈnæns] is a decentralized platform that facilitates the creation of a variety of DeFi instruments and products, oriented at people with no or limited programming skills.

It is designed from scratch to unlock the creative potential present in so-called “financial engineers”, individuals that are well versed and experienced in the financial industry (products and services), whom, despite their expertise, have difficulty translating their ideas into actual products due to technical challenges. “dfinance” will enable them to rapidly implement their ideas and test drive them in a secure environment. The emphasis is placed on recreating the environments that these creators are most used to, with the learning curve being as steep as possible. Once these ideas prove themselves worthy of further time and resource investment, they can be leveraged by building a team to create further extensive functionality for these products.

# Parts
* A consensus mechanism based on Tendermint PoS which is implemented by Cosmos, enabling a decentralization of block producers and ensuring a real trustless environment.
* PegZone which enables an interoperability with 1st layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, and Bitcoin and others, tapping into the liquidity captured by these blockchains coins and tokens.
* Libra's Move language and virtual machine to enable the creation of a powerful code execution environment on decentralized nodes with all the security offered by language's strict semantics, syntax and ownership model.
* Decentralized oracles providing connection between DeFinance platform and the real world financial instruments and sources of data.
* Powerful visual strict language to describe and safely run your own financial instruments with no knowledge in programming.
