# Introduction

## What is dfinance

«dfinance» \[diːfaɪˈnæns\] is a decentralized platform that facilitates the creation of a variety of DeFi instruments and products, oriented at people with no or limited programming skills.

It is designed from scratch to unlock the creative potential present in so-called “financial engineers”, individuals that are well versed and experienced in the financial industry \(products and services\), whom, despite their expertise, have difficulty translating their ideas into actual products due to technical challenges. “dfinance” will enable them to rapidly implement their ideas and test drive them in a secure environment.

The emphasis is on recreating the environments which these creators are most used to, with the learning curve being as steep as possible. Once ideas prove themselves worthy of time and resource investment, it leverage by assembling a team to create further extensive functionality for these products.

## Parts

* A **consensus mechanism** based on Tendermint PoS implemented by Cosmos, enabling a decentralization of block producers and ensuring a real trustless environment
* **PegZone** which enables an interoperability with 1st layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, and Bitcoin and others, tapping into the liquidity captured by these blockchains coins and tokens.
* Libra's **Move language** and virtual machine to enable the creation of a powerful code execution environment on decentralized nodes with all the security offered by language's strict semantics, syntax and ownership model.
* **Decentralized oracles** providing connection between DeFinance platform and the real world financial instruments and sources of data.
* Powerful **high-level visual language** empowering a safe way to design, deploy and run your own financial instruments, with no prior knowledge in programming required
