# Introduction

## What is dfinance

«dfinance» \[diːfaɪˈnæns\] is a decentralized platform that facilitates the creation of a variety of DeFi instruments and products, oriented at people with no or limited programming skills.

It is designed from scratch to unlock the creative potential present in so-called “financial engineers”, individuals that are well versed and experienced in the financial industry \(products and services\), whom, despite their expertise, have difficulty translating their ideas into actual products due to technical challenges. “dfinance” will enable them to rapidly implement their ideas and test drive them in a secure environment. The emphasis is placed on recreating the environments that these creators are most used to, with the learning curve being as shallow as possible. Once these ideas prove themselves worthy of further time and resource investment, they can be leveraged by assembling a team to create further extensive functionality for these products.

## dfinance highlights

* A consensus mechanism based on Tendermint PoS, originally developed by Cosmos, enabling a decentralization of block producers and ensuring a real trustless environment
* PegZone enabling an interoperability with 1st layer blockchains such as Ethereum, EOS, Bitcoin and others, tapping into the value and liquidity captured by these blockchains coins and tokens
* Libra's Move language and virtual machine enabling the creation of a powerful code execution environment on decentralized nodes with the added security offered by language's strict semantics, syntax and ownership model
* Decentralized oracles providing connection between DeFinance platform and the real world financial instruments and sources of data
* Powerful high-level visual language empowering a safe way to design, deploy and run your own financial instruments, with no prior knowledge in programming required
