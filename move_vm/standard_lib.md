# Standard Library

Standard **Move VM** library is default modules that already developed and developers can use in developing new modules, scripts.

They all placed on the address **0x0**. So when you import something from **0x0**, you import standard modules, like:

```text
import 0x0.Account;
import 0x0.Coins;
```

You can look for actual standard modules in [dmv](https://github.com/dfinance/dvm/tree/master/lang) repository.
