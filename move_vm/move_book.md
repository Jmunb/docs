# Move Book

As Move language is very young, there is not much information about it, this is why we are ready to present you **Move Book** - first book about Move language, that contains a lot of information about Move syntax, resources, and techniques, that will increase your performance while you developing something new with Move language. 

It will be a good step to read the book at the same time or after reading current documentation, as our documentation is more about Dfinance protocol rather than Move language.

Move book developed by our team member Damir Shamayev with all support of Dfinance and can be found on the official website - [move-book.com](https://move-book.com).
