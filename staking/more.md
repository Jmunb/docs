# More about staking

As our documentation describing dfinance protocol futures, we can't describe everything related (protocols, libraries, modules, that we using) but can provide links for your to learning.

## Tendermint

As dfinance based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) protocol, it's utilize Tendermint features for consensus, security, p2p communications, look at Tendermint [documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/#).

## Cosmos SDK

As dfinance based on Cosmos SDK and inherits standard cosmos modules, you can look also at Cosmos documentation, specifically:

    * [staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/staking/)
    * [slashing](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/slashing/01_concepts.html) 
    * [mint](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/mint/01_concepts.html)
    * [distribution](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/distribution/)
 
Some details, that current documentation miss or considers not important you can find there.
