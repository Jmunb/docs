# More on staking

As our documentation describes dfinance protocol futures, we cannot describe everything (such as protocols, libraries, modules, that we're using), but we can provide links for you to learn more.

## Tendermint

Dfinance uses [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) protocol. We use Tendermint for consensus, security and p2p communications. Here is [Tendermint documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/#).

## Cosmos SDK

As dfinance is built with Cosmos SDK and inherits standard cosmos modules, you can look at Cosmos documentation, specifically:

- [staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/staking/)
- [slashing](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/slashing/01_concepts.html)
- [mint](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/mint/01_concepts.html)
- [distribution](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/distribution/)

Some details, that current documentation misses or considers not important you can find there.
